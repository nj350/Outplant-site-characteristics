Assessment of site characteristics which influence coral outplant success (Acropora cervicornis survival, A. cervicornis breakage which influences growth, and boulder coral survival)

Spatial characteristics looks at site level variation e.g., latitude, depth
ACER survival analysis, Breakage analysis and Reef-building coral analysis assess plot/array level variation (small spatial scale) to identify characteristics within sites that increase survival probability

Modelling uses Random Forest regression to assess variable importance. Then GLMMs of the most important predictors (account for >75% variation explained). Quadratics fitted in some GLMMs for non-linear relationships. Interaction fitted
